# About the DAM profile

Dependability Analysis and Modeling (DAM) profile enables to specify dependability requirements and properties in UML-based models.
It is aimed at supporting automatic transformations of UML models to formal models for dependability assessment purposes.

DAM profile relies on the OMG standard MARTE (Modelling and Analysis of Real-Time Embedded systems) profile.

DAM provides the following top-level components:

* DAM Library: includes the basic and complex data-types used to define the stereotype tags.
* DAM UML Extensions: includes the set of stereotypes.


# About this implementation of the DAM Profile

This plugin reimplements the DAM profile available at https://bitbucket.org/mberenguer/masdes-downloads/wiki/Home, and unifies the type system, solving problems with the redefinition of MARTE datatypes.
